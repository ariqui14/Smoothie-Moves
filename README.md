# Smoothie-Moves
Unity Game Engine Architecture project

Smoothie Moves is a game where you play as a smoothie tender, controlled by WASD keys. You serve a multitude of customers and the goal is to serve as many customers as you can in one minute. All assets used are from the Unity store, not designed by me.
